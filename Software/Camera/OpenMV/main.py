    Draws an arrow on a canvas to represent vehicle speed and steering angle. The arrow's
    length corresponds to the vehicle's speed, while its direction is adjusted according
    to the steering angle. The arrow length is scaled proportionally to a defined maximum.

    Parameters:
        canvas: A drawing surface where the arrow will be drawn. It must have methods
                to retrieve width and height, and a method `draw_arrow` to render the
                arrow.
        vehicle_speed: A numeric value representing the vehicle's speed as a percentage
                       of maximum speed.
        steering_angle: A numeric value indicating the steering angle, where 0 is 45째
                        to the left, 50 is vertical, and 100 is 45째 to the right.

    Initializes the camera with predetermined settings suitable for

    The function performs the following steps:
    - Resets the camera to initial state
    - Sets the pixel format to grayscale
    - Sets the frame size to QVGA (320x240 pixels)
    - Skips frames for a specified time to allow the camera to stabilize
