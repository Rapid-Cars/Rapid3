Installation instructions:

1. All files are a few millimeters to tall because my 3D-printer doesnÂ´t want to print those. For your prints you can just place the stl file slightly below the print plate in your slicer.
2. The file "Base Camera Mount" is placed on top of the central carbon fiber structure. It replaces the holders of the carbon fiber thing that holds the rear voltage converter
3. Use 6 threaded M3 inserts on that (The center ones from the top the outer ones from the bottom)
4. The file "Angled camera Adapter" is screwed into the "Base Camera Mount". 
5. Use one M6 insert in the angled hole
6. An M6 rod is screwed into "Angled camera Adapter"
7. "Camera Top Mount" also needs an M6 insert. It is compatible with both the original camera holder and the improved one (see /3D-Files/Camera mount/Camera Mount v2.3mf)
